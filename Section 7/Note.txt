  the difference

between attribute and structural directives,

and what this star means on the structural directives.

Well, I already said it, right?

We got attribute and structural directives.

Attribute directives are called like this

because they sit on elements, Just like attributes,

and structural directives basically do the same,

but they also change the structure

of the DOM around this element.

If you have NGF on a paragraph, if that condition is false,

this paragraph is removed from the DOM,

so the overall view container is affected,

whereas on the attribute directive,

you never destroy an element from the DOM,

you only change properties of that element,

for example, the background color.

So, that is why we have attribute directives

only affecting the element they sit on,

and structural directives,

which also affect the whole DO
