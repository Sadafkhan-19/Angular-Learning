Because a service is basically just another piece in your Angular app, another class you can add

which acts a central repository.

As a central business unit you could say something where you can store where you can centralize your code in.

So we could create a log service, for example to centralize our log statement.

We could create a user service to manage the data storage here.

##What is a dependency injector?

Well, a dependency is something a class of ours will depend on.For example, the new account component

depends on that logging service because we want to call a method in that service.

And the dependence injector simply injects this dependency, injects an instance off this class

i to our component automatically.
