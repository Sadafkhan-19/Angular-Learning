String interpolation - Any expression which can be resolved
to a string in the end.
That's the only condition for a string interpolation syntax here.

Interpolation refers to embedding expressions into marked up text. By default, interpolation uses the double curly braces {{ and }} as delimiters.

Square brackets indicate to angular that we're using property binding that we want to dynamically bind some property and disabled the HTML attribute.

if you want to output something in your template

print some text to it, use string and interpolation.

If you want to change some property, be that

of an HTML element or as you later learn off a directive

or a component, typically use property binding.
